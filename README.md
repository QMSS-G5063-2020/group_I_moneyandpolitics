Ideas For Data Viz Project
Data sources:
Kaggle
ProPublica
Harvard
UCI Social Network Data
Census API

Project Ideas:

Theme: The Language of Power
Techniques: text analysis, social network analysis
Dataset: UN general Assembly, NATO speeches, # joint press appearances
Description: Analyzing soft and hard power through text analysis. Would require web scraping. We could also look at all the countries that currently have nuclear bombs and analyze their speeches at the general assembly versus those who do not.

Theme: Brains vs. Bronze?
Techniques: Spatial, plots,  bar graphs
Dataset: Olympic medal data, education performance data
Description: Looking to see similarities and differences with the two datasets to see if there are insights about individual countries
