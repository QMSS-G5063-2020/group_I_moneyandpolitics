# group_I_moneyandpolitics

We are interested in exploring lobbying reports submitted in compliance with the U.S. Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) to find insights on how money influences the political process. Utilizing 7 datasets regarding LDA from Open Secrets, we will explore the unique structures and relationships of lobbying in politics.
